## Example

To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory first.

## Requirements

## Installation

POPDataSource is available through [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod 'POPDataSource'
```

### Swift Package Manager

The [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/) is a tool for automating the distribution of Swift code and is integrated into the `swift` compiler. It is in early development, but POPDataSource does support its use on supported platforms.

Once you have your Swift package set up, adding POPDataSource as a dependency is as easy as adding it to the `dependencies` value of your `Package.swift`.

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/dsay/POPDataSources.git")
]
```
